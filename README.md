# bigboy | RGH Multi Tool [unfinished/free source]
A modded Xbox 360 tool i stopped working on since i made the switch to learning c++ and also doing ps4 tools.
> [!CAUTION]
> THIS STATE OF THE TOOL **PROBABLY** DOESNT SUPPORT XDK, if you are trying for anything that isnt standard rgh, **REMOVE CONSOLE INFORMATION, MOD LOADING (IF INCLUDED) AND SPOOFING MOST LILELY WILL NOT WORK EITHER**.

> [!NOTE]
> The tool **DOES NOT** have a blue bar at the top, this is because of MaterialSkin in the editor.
