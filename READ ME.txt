Imma start off by saying, i do not care about this community like i used to, i burnt myself out on a path to find some things which were just too advanced for me to figure out, this tool was a major learning project for many reasons.

Games were not finished, i have stolen and updated or just straight yoinked lots of things and i dont feel bad about it in the slightest because these people actively sold shit that's not theirs, well we won't be selling it.

If you like the tool and would like to further develop, feel free, just dont skid your name onto it and claim it as yours since you didnt make it, thanks.

If you'd like to get in contact with me, my discord is: kingcalzone - you may also find me in the r/MW2, A+ Lobbies or the xbGuard Discord server.
